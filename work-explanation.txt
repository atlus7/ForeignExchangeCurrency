What works?
* All minimal requirements should be met.
* Validates input to be number, if not input is set to its default value, 10.
* App makes sure that user cannot add currencies that have already been added.
* App makes sure that add button disappear once all the availabe currencies have been added.


What my version does not handle/take care of:
* Responsive web design.
* Decimal places.
* Building automated tests are usually done by QA Engineer in my previous companies, so I have no experience in that. I would love to learn, though.
